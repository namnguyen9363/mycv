        <h3>Technical skills</h3>
        <p>
          Your ability to accomplish specific tasks like cooking, computer programming, or teaching, are called technical skills. They relate to a particular occupation. You may have learned technical skills from past work experience, school or
          training. These skills are often included in job listings to describe the tasks of a position.

        <h3>Soft skills</h3>
        <p>
          Employers also want employees who fit in and get along well in the workplace. That requires soft skills. These are so valuable that soft skills are often the reason employers decide whether to keep or promote an employee. Some soft skills
          can be taught in school. But most you learn in everyday life and can improve at any time.</p>
